commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time.\n","              Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time data.\n","              Examples of time series are heights of ocean tides, counts of sunspots, and the daily closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n","              Time series are very frequently plotted via run charts (a temporal line chart).\n","              Time series are used in statistics, signal processing, pattern recognition, econometrics, mathematical finance, weather forecasting, earthquake prediction,
